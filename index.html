            <h1>What is Kazan BBQ, Ramen and Bar?</h1>
            <p>We are a small Japanese restaurant located on the first floor of Crossgates Mall in Albany, NY. We serve ramen (both regional variants and customizable), BBQ, as well as other refreshments such as imported Japanese beer and sake just to name a few.</p>
            <p>Although we are open most days of the week, we are closed on Mondays due to the fact that we make our own in-house noodles for our ramen.</p>
            <p>Please give us a visit!</p>
